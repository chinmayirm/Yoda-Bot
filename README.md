# Yoda Bot Chat UI

A minimal conversational AI that responds like Master Yoda. Built with Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT API, this chatbot transforms your everyday queries into Yoda-style responses. Built to encourage self-reflection, humor, and introspection through a fun interface.

## Features

- Yoda-style grammar conversion using prompt engineering
- Interactive chat UI using Streamlit
- Real-time responses powered by OpenAI GPT
- Local image avatar support (Yoda's face)

## Why Yoda?

Master Yoda often places the verb and subject at the end of the sentence, offering wisdom in a cryptic but thought-provoking form. This design promotes a unique way of reflecting on user inputs. Think of it as introspection, guided by a Jedi.

Also just because I am a massive Star Wars fan.
